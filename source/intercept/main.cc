// How it should works?
//
// - Choose interception mode (wrapper or preload)
//   - Set up environment variables accordingly
// - Create communication channel for `er` to report process execution
//   - Listens to the channel and collect the received reports
// - Calls `er` to supervise the build (with the received command).
//   - Wait until the child process terminates. (store exit code)
// - Close communication channel.
// - Flush output.
// - Return child exit code.
//
// Communication channel means: filesystem or socket. Do migration easy,
// start with the filesystem (means create a temporary directory and
// delete it when everything is finished). This can be later changed to
// UNIX or TCP sockets.

int main() {
    return 0;
